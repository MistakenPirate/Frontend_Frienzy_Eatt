Here’s a basic `README.md` file template for running a Next.js app:

```markdown
# Next.js App

This is a Next.js application. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the app, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Recommended: LTS version)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (Node package manager)

You can check if these are installed by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
# Or for Yarn
yarn -v
```

If they are not installed, download and install them from the links above.

## Setting Up the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:

   First, clone the project to your local machine using `git`:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-folder>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   Once inside the project directory go to the folder Samato, run the following command to install all required dependencies:

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Or if you’re using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

## Running the Application

Once dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

### Using npm:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Or using Yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start the development server, and you can open the app in your browser at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```
